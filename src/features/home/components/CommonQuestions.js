    { que: 'What is Zoom app?', ans: 'Zoom is an online video conferencing application that is being used for conducting online dance sessions. It can be downloaded on mobile or laptop. Once downloaded the link that we share works, that doesnâ€™t need any password.'},
    { que: 'Is the class suitable for a beginner?', ans: 'Yes, the classes are carefully curated so that it suits every level of dancer. As long as you have the spirit to dance, we welcome everyone.'},
    { que: 'What device and internet connectivity is required?', ans: 'We recommend a laptop or desktop but if you are using a mobile, it must be placed at least 3 ft distance from you so that the instructor can see you dance and correct the steps. The bandwidth of a broadband or a 4G that supports a video call in WhatsApp or Skype will be enough to use the Zoom app.'},
